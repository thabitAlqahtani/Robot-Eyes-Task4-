Introduction: 
In this task, we are aiming to design a circuit of the robot eyes. The idea is to connect two LEDs to a battery. In my opinion, I think they has to be in parallel because if they are, they will have the same voltage, so, we will use the same battery. In the first picture (named Robot-eyes-simple), there is a simple circuit when two LEDs connected in parallel and connected to a battery with a resistor. But in the second one (named Robot-eyes-real), there is the circuit that is really used, the idea of the circuit because voltage rate of the LED is limited and cannot stand 9V, so we need the circuit.

First circuit (Robot-eyes-simple):
In this circuit, LEDs connected in parallel. The positive node of the battery connected to a resistor, which is connected to the positive of the LED. This positive node is connected to the other LED positive node. And all the negative nods of the three components are connected to each other.

second circuit (Robot-eyes-real):
In this circuit, LEDs are also connected in parallel. The battery is connected to a capacitor, which is connected to the first node of the regulator. The second and third node of the regulator is connected to a resistor, the second node is also connected to another resistor. The first resistor is also connected to another capacitor which is connected to the LEDs. The LEDs share the same positive and negative nodes since they are in parallel. The idea of this circuit is to change and regulate the voltage for the LEDs.
